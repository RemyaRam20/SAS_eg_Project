# SAS_eg_Project - Statistics and Insights from Data on the NBA (1947-2017)

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America (USA); 
composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada).
It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. 
NBA players are some of the world's highest paid athletes by average annual salary.
The analysis focuses on several topics including the evolution of the 3pt shot, player height,
the Universities that produce the most NBA athletes and PER (player efficiency rating) by position. 

3 problems solved

Problem 1
 The NBA draft and how it has evolved over the years since 1947 to 2017.
 The first problem that I wanted to highlight is about the universities from which the largest number of players were drafted 
 over each decade. This result will give us a pretty good idea about the top universities from which players were drafted. 
 Since the dataset consists of 70 plus years, we decided to incorporate the years into (ten-year ranges) decades. 

 Problem 2
 Summary Analysis of Points Per Game (PPG) and the Evolution of the 2 and 3 points shot in the NBA.
 This problem focuses on PPG and shooting accuracy considering the following terms:
Total points scored (PPG)
Player Position (Pos)
Avg. 2-pointer (including 2 PT %)
Avg. 3-pointer (including 3 PT %)

Problem 3
 In this problem we will take a closer look at the height of basketball players. 
 It has long been known that basketball players are tall. 
 But how tall are basketball players compared to average people? 
 How have the heights of basketball players changed throughout the decades? 
 And is it possible for a normal-sized person to be successful as a basketball player? 
 The data contained in our tables made it possible to answer all these questions.
